-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installation prerequisities.

CLRadeonExtender doesn't require many libraries and dependencies.
It can be installed on the 32-bit/64-bit machines.
Currently, the OpenCL support for AMD Catalyst (for the OpenCL applications)
is disabled by default (enablement is not recommended in current development
stage).

This package provides source code and requires:

* C++11 compliant compiler (Clang++ or GCC 4.7 or later)
* GNU make tool
* CMake system (2.6 or later)
* Threads support (for Linux recommended NPTL)
* 'elf.h' include file (should be installed in standard)
* Linux system

Optionally for clwrapper (an OpenCL wrapper that replaces AMD Catalyst driver
behaviour) requires:

* libOpenCL.so
* OpenCL ICD (for example from AMD Catalyst driver)
* AMD Catalyst driver.

These utilities is working with an OpenCL kernel binaries compiled for the
Radeon GPU's based on GCN 1.0/1.1/1.2 architecture. Any binaries compiled
for older Radeons (VLIW architecture) has not been handled.

2. Compilation

To build system you should create a build directory in source code package:

  mkdir build

and run:

  cmake ..

Optional CMake configuration options for build:

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - type of build (Release, Debug, GCCSan, GCCSSP).
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - prefix for installation (for example '/usr/local')
BUILD_32BIT - build also 32-bit binaries
BUILD_TESTS - build all tests
BUILD_DOCUMENTATION - build the Doxygen documentation
NO_STATIC - no static libraries
OPENCL_DIST_DIR - an OpenCL directory distribution installation (optional)

You can just add one or many of these options to cmake command:

  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

After creating Makefiles scripts you can compile project:

  make or make -jX - where X is number of processors.

After building you can check whether project is working (if you will build tests):

  ctest

Creating documentation will be done by this command
(if you will enable a building documentation):

  make Docs

3. Installation

Installation is easy. Just run command:

  make install
  
4. clwrapper

Currently, the clwrapper have not been tested on real AMD Catalyst environment.

5. Uninstallation

In a build directory is a 'install_manifest.txt' file that contains all installed files.
You can remove these files by using command:

  rm -f `cat install_manifest.txt`

Don't forget to keep 'build' directory after installation.
