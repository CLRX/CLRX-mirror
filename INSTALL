-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installation prerequisities.

CLRadeonExtender doesn't require many libraries and dependencies.
It can be installed on the 32-bit/64-bit machines.
Currently, the OpenCL support for AMD Catalyst (for the OpenCL applications)
is disabled by default (enablement is not recommended in current development
stage).

This package provides source code and requires:

* C++11 compliant compiler (Clang++ or GCC 4.7 or later, MSVC 2015 or later)
* any build system supported by CMake (GNU make, NMake, Visual Studio, ...)
* CMake system (2.8 or later)
* Threads support (for Linux, recommended NPTL)
* Unix-like (Linux or BSD) system or Windows system

Optionally for clwrapper (an OpenCL wrapper that replaces AMD Catalyst driver
behaviour) requires:

* libOpenCL.so or OpenCL.dll
* OpenCL ICD (for example from AMD Catalyst driver)
* AMD Catalyst driver or AMDGPU-PRO driver

and documentation requires:

* pod2man utility for Unix manuals
* markdown_py utility for CLRX Documentation
* Doxygen for CLRX API Documentation

These utilities is working with the OpenCL kernel binaries compiled for the
Radeon GPU's based on GCN 1.0/1.1/1.2 architecture. Any binaries compiled
for older Radeons (VLIW architecture) has not been handled.

2. Compilation

To build system you should create the build directory in source code package:

  mkdir build

and run:

  cmake .. [cmake options]

Optional CMake configuration options for build:

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - type of build (Release, Debug, GCCSan, GCCSSP).
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - prefix for installation (for example '/usr/local')
BUILD_32BIT - build 32-bit binaries (works only in the Unix/Linux 64-bit environment)
BUILD_TESTS - build all tests
BUILD_SAMPLES - build OpenCL samples
BUILD_DOCUMENTATION - build project documentation (doxygen, unix manuals, user doc)
BUILD_DOXYGEN - build doxygen documentation
BUILD_MANUAL - build Unix manual pages
BUILD_CLRXDOC - build CLRX user documentation
BUILD_STATIC_EXE - build with statically linked executables
GCC5CXX11NEWABI - build with new GCC5 C++11 ABI (required if GCC uses old ABI by default)
NO_STATIC - no static libraries
NO_CLWRAPPER - do not build CLRXWrapper
CPU_ARCH - target CPU architecture (in GCC parameter to -march, for MSVC
  parameter to /arch:)
OPENCL_DIST_DIR - an OpenCL directory distribution installation (optional)

You can just add one or many of these options to cmake command:

  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

or for Microsoft Visual C++ (for NMake):

  cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" [cmake configuration options]

or for Microsoft Visual C++ (for same Visual Studio)

  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio XXXXXX [arch]" [cmake configuration options]

where XXXX - version of Visual Studio (7, 14 2015, ...).
arch - architecture (Win64, ARM) (optional).

After creating Makefiles scripts you can compile project:

  make or make -jX - where X is number of processors.

or (for NMake)

  nmake

or just execute build option in Visual Studio.

After building you can check whether project is working (if you will build tests):

  ctest

2.1. Windows and MSVC

CLRadeonExtender has been compiled under Windows 8.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
Community version.

2.2. FreeBSD

Due to unknown reasons, the compilation under clang++ will be failed. We recommend to use
gcc compiler to build the CLRadeonExtender. You should prepend cmake command by `CXX=g++`:
`CXX=g++ cmake .. ....`.

3. Installation

Installation is easy. Just run command:

  make install

or (for NMake)

  nmake install
  
4. clwrapper

CLWrapper integrates the CLRX assembler with the AMD Catalyst driver by using
wrapper mechanism and embeds an assembler to AMD OpenCL implementation.
Building an assembler programs will be possible by passing an '-xasm' option which
should be appended to build options, like following example:

clBuildProgram(program, num_devices, devices, "-xasm", NULL, NULL);

Installation is easy. However, it requires some changes on an OpenCL configuration:

Remove amdocl64.icd and/or amdocl32.icd (if 32-bit system)
from directory '/etc/OpenCL/vendors'
(before, we recommend to make backup that directory).
Create the 'clrx.icd' file on /etc/OpenCL/vendors/ with content: 'libCLRXWrapper.so'.
That's all. Now you can call an assembler through clBuildProgram on your applications.

Important Attention: CLWrapper make some changes on the program environment and changes
behaviour of the OpenCL routines. This is still the experimental stuff and
we recommend to not using its on the deployed/production systems.

DO NOT FORGET to revert these changes before uninstallation.

5. Uninstallation

In the build directory is the 'install_manifest.txt' file that contains all installed files.
You can remove these files by using command:

  rm -f `cat install_manifest.txt`

DO NOT FORGET to keep 'build' directory after installation.
