1. About project.

Currently, main goal is low-level development tools for Radeon GPU's based on
the GCN 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.4 (AMD VEGA) architecture likes assembler, disassembler, optionally
linker. These utilities will be designed to be compatible with AMD Catalyst
drivers and an open-source Gallium drivers.
CLRadeonExtender doesn't require AMD Catalyst drivers and any other drivers
for Radeon graphics cards, because delivers standalone utilities.

Project is in: https://clrx.nativeboinc.org (or http://clrx.nativeboinc.org if SSL
certificate doesn't work) and https://github.com/CLRX/CLRX-mirror.

2. Support and license

Text of the license is in the COPYING, COPYING.LIB and COPYING.DOC files
(GPLv2, LGPLv2 and GFDL).

3. Utilities

CLRadeonExtender provides two tools:

* clrxasm - an GCN assembler (compatible with GNU as).
* clrxdisasm - an GCN disassembler

Currently, these tools can handle the AMD Catalyst OpenCL binaries,
the GalliumCompute binaries, AMD OpenCL 2.0 binaries and ROCm binaries.

4. Documentation

Currently, the Doxygen documentation and onlint CLRX documentation available.

5. Installation

Read the INSTALL file.

6. Usage of libraries in binaries

The default (without '-gcc5' in name) binary libraries for Linux are compiled
for C++11 old ABI, hence you must add option -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 to
compiler commands if you are using GCC 5.0 or higher or compiler that by default
uses new C++11 ABI.

7. Platform support notes

CLRadeonExtender requires in original MinGW some third-party headers:
https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads. After that changes, CLRXWrapper still is
not compilable, so you should disable it by enabling NO_CLWRAPPER option CMake while
generating Makefiles.

On CygWin environment you should point OpenCL distribution directory to AMD APP SDK or
system distribution instead CygWin OpenCL.
