This project is in experimental stage of the development.

Currently, main goal is low-level development tools for Radeon GPU's based on
the GCN 1.0/1.1/1.2 architecture likes assembler, disassembler, optionally
linker. These utilities will be designed to be compatible with AMD Catalyst
drivers and an open-source Gallium drivers.
CLRadeonExtender doesn't require AMD Catalyst drivers and any other drivers
for Radeon graphics cards, because delivers standalone utilities.

CLRadeonExtender provides two tools:

* clrxasm - an GCN assembler (compatible with GNU as).
* clrxdisasm - an GCN disassembler

Currently, these tools can handle the AMD Catalyst OpenCL binaries,
the GalliumCompute binaries, AMD OpenCL 2.0 binaries and ROCm binaries.

4. Documentation
