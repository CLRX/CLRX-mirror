This project is in experimental stage of the development.

Currently, main goal is low-level development tools for Radeon GPU's based on
the GCN 1.0/1.1/1.2 architecture likes assembler, disassembler, optionally

drivers and an open-source Gallium drivers.
CLRadeonExtender doesn't require AMD Catalyst drivers and any other drivers
for Radeon graphics cards, because delivers standalone utilities.

Currently, these tools can handle the AMD Catalyst OpenCL binaries and
the GalliumCompute binaries.
