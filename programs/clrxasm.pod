=head1 SYNOPSIS

clrxasm [-6Sw?] [-D SYM[=VALUE]] [-I PATH] [-o OUTFILE] [-b BINFORMAT]
[-g GPUDEVICE] [-A ARCH] [-t VERSION] [--defsym=SYM[=VALUE]] [--includePath=PATH]
[--output OUTFILE] [--binaryFormat=BINFORMAT] [--64bit] [--gpuType=GPUDEVICE]
[--arch=ARCH] [--driverVersion=VERSION] [--forceAddSymbols] [--noWarnings]
[--help] [--usage] [file...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is CLRadeonExtender assembler. This assembler can assemble code for all Radeon GPU's
that based on the GCN1.0/1.1/1.2 architecture and it can generate AMD Catalyst
OpenCL binaries and the GalliumCompute OpenCL binaries. It is compatible with GNU as
and support the almost GNU as pseudo-operations (directives) including macros and
repetitions.

=head1 OPTIONS

Following options clrxasm can recognize:

=over 8

=item B<-D SYMBOL=[VALUE]>, B<--defsym=SYMBOL[=VALUE]>

Define symbol. Value is optional and if it is not given then assembler set 0 by default.
This option can be occurred many times to defining many symbols.

=item B<-I PATH>, B<--includePath=PATH>

Add to search path list an include path. Assembler begins search from current directory
and follows to next include paths.
This option can be occurred many times to adding many include paths.

=item B<-o FILENAME>, B<--output=FILENAME>

Set output file name. By default assembler write output to the 'a.out' file.

=item B<-b BINFORMAT>, B<--binaryFormat=BINFORMAT>

Set output binary format. This settings can be overriden in source code.
Assembler accepts following formats: 'amd', 'gallium', 'rawcode'.

=item B<-6>, B<--64bit>

Enable generating of the 64-bit binaries (only for AMD catalyst format).

=item B<-g GPUDEVICE>, B<--gpuType=GPUDEVICE>

Choose device type. This option replaces previously choosen architecture by
architecture of choosen device. Device type name is case-insensitive.
Currently is supported: 
CapeVerde, Pitcairn, Tahiti, Oland, Bonaire, Spectre, Spooky, Kalindi,
Hainan, Hawaii, Iceland, Tonga, Mullins, Fiji and Carrizo.

=item B<-A ARCH>, B<--arch=ARCH>

Choose device architecture. This options replaces previously choosen device by
first device that have choosen arhitecture. Architecture name is case-insensitive.
List of supported architectures:
GCN1.0, GCN1.1 and GCN1.2.

=item B<-t VERSION>, B<--driverVersion=VERSION>

Choose AMD Catalyst OpenCL driver version. Version can retrieved from clinfo program
that display field 'Driver version' where version is. Version is number in that form:
MajorVersion*100 + MinorVersion.

=item B<-S>, B<--forceAddSymbols>

Add all non-local symbols to binaries. By default any assembler does not add any symbols
to keep compatibility with original format.

=item B<-w>, B<--noWarnings>

Do not print all warnings.

=item B<-?>, B<--help>

Print help and list of the options.

=item B<--usage>

Print usage for this program

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE

Returns zero if assembler succeeded, otherwise returns 1.
